# Clock
This is a Vanilla JS project designed to make a simple 12-hour clock. I followed tutorials (can be found in the diary.txt file).

There is simple HTML and CSS to demonstrate the JavaScript concepts used

# Concepts used
- Conditionals
- Termary operators
- Date constructor (object-oriented programming)
- DOM manipulation
- Template literals
- Methods (setTimeout)

# To run (if using VSCode)
- Clone repo
- Right click on 'clock.html' in the '/static' folder.
- Select 'Copy Path'
- Paste path into browser
